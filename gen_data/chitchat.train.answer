would you please taste it ?
the personnel office is first door on the left
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 seconds
we have a nice steel pad back there
i ' m sorry colonel but your story won ' t stand up against this evidence
perhaps one of those life signs belongs to your captain
never mind about loving me
if watchin is all you ' r e gonna do then you ' r e gonna watch your life go by without ya
the tank british they had passed
yes but i
he feels if he can penetrate the german high command we shouldn ' t have any difficulty getting up there
who are you ?
i might just elect to follow the criminal profession
well that ' s why they paid so well
otherwise they won ' t respond like ladies
they can ' t possibly hit us from the boat
your man ?
do you happen to know another sailor a fellow who goes to museums ?
and you know it ' s a serious problem
i ' m not going in there mate i value my health to much
what ' s up ?
i ' m so happy that you can see now
okay well the problem is we don ' t know if the road bumps are magical or just a normal part of development
of course no one s been sleeping much
then i ' m gonna send him back to ireland in a body bag
who knows ?
you are so wonderful my nando
but terrible publicity if you take it away
why don ' t you just put up a sign saying cemetery bodies buried here ?
that ' s the white queen ' s plan
now she cannot be human and she cannot be wolf
i expect trouble to come looking for us but i ' d rather face it sooner than later
you religious sherry ?
if i win by chance shaolin kung fu won ' t be said to have lost to other school
no one will care if i leave right ?
yeah but we could go at any time
i swear to serve your cause against all others
let ' s slow it up a little bit
last thursday week
we were descending at normal speed and were suddenly pulled down at tremendous speed
the landlady said when he came back from miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named mary
he spat on the floor as i went by
half of the refugees from the north of the country were women and children of all ages
i don ' t think that true
it ' d be good
she ' s a headstrong girl
mind you even i didn ' t guess that at once
with the limited equipment we have it will probably take three trips to carry enough bombs to the target to destroy it
in that case
once again the eyes of the nation have turned here to this tiny village in western pennsylvania
so if you have something to say to me say it in front of him
are you gonna live by yourself in such a big house ?
yes it ' s punishment
tell him where to take you
i loved it
only the farmers have won
so they send interpol to arrest the guy
see the problem with trying to appeal to its human side ?
he was by the pool next thing he has brain damage
that shouldn ' t be too difficult
yeah i do
i was telling your friend there is work for both of you here
oh nurse don ' t you think this is a iittle bit one sided ?
the two of us are no match for him
and you ' r e still the hardheaded scot aren ' t you ?
i don ' t need charity off trash like you
i don ' t have time to explain
so how does he reach us when a simple swallow is such a huge task ?
it might help us get rolling
don ' t you know you ' r e threatening him ?
so tell me
this way there is less fighting in the mornings
a bicycle camping gear a heart shaped locket
you know it ' s funny it sort of looked like a diary when i came in
sounds to me like the perfect way to play it
you got to take everything the white man says and use it against him
well give my love to your wife
it shouldn ' t damage the bastard unless its skin is thinner than ours
you got an explanation why you was firing that weapon breaking a city ordinance ?
look baby down here o sole mio is like the star spangled banner back home
give it to me
whoever this thief was he didn ' t have to tear up the place like this
you betrayed her trust
i want to belong to be needed
manuela i ' m so happy to see you
even if you are a good swimmer you won ' t have time to make it
neither confirm deny nor discuss sharon
so then the valet pulls up and i ' m all
those are 00 000 yen
that sounds like an excellent idea
next on the agenda
but that ' s not true !
burning as if it were a lamp
they shot him to pieces six miles down the river poor man
i don ' t believe god himself would entirely meet with her approval
facing his entire staff
not one of us would last ten seconds inside a prison
i have no reason to tell them they ' r e wrong
maybe we guys know more about what ' s going on than most people
will you please return the capital ?
